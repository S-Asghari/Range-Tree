# Range-Tree

Input format:
First line shows the number of input nodes.
In the second line, x value of each node and in the third line, its corresponding y value are given.
Fourth line shows the number of following operations.
From the fifth line to the end, each line indicades 4 values which are coordinates of a rectangle(in this order: x1, y1, x2, y2).
We Assume that the number of nodes and operations doesn't exceed 10^4.

Output format:
For each input operation, the program will print out x value and y value (in its next line) of nodes which are located in the rectangle (Output nodes are sorted in the decreasing order of their y values).
If there is no node located in the rectangle, the program will print out "None".
